# Tailwind CSS v4 Rules File for LLM Optimization
 Use utility-first classes for styling components. Utilize Tailwind's responsive utilities for mobile-first design

## General Rules

1. **Use CSS-First Configuration:**
   - Tailwind v4 eliminates the need for `tailwind.config.js` by allowing configuration directly in CSS using `@theme`.
   
2. **Enforce Performance Optimization:**
   - Avoid unnecessary class duplication.
   - Utilize `@layer` for grouping styles efficiently.
   
3. **Maintain Readability and Reusability:**
   - Use semantic class names where applicable.
   - Define reusable styles with CSS variables inside `@theme`.


### CSS-First Theme Configuration
```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: oklch(0.7 0.28 145);
  --font-display: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --breakpoint-lg: 1024px;
}
```

### Extending with `@layer`
```css
@layer utilities {
  .text-balance {
    text-wrap: balance;
  }
}
```

## Performance Guidelines

1. **Use Utility Classes Efficiently:**
   - Avoid deeply nested elements that require excessive utility classes.
   - Keep class lists short and modular.

2. **Leverage Tailwind's JIT Engine:**
   - Remove unused CSS classes to reduce file size.
   - Use dynamic class generation efficiently.

3. **Minimize Redundant Styles:**
   - Define global styles in `@theme` to reduce repetition.

## Best Practices for Component Development
  **Avoid Unnecessary Custom Styles:**
   - Stick to Tailwindâ€™s utility classes as much as possible.
   - Use `@apply` sparingly to maintain clarity.
