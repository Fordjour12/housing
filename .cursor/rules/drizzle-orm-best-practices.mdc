- Use type-safe queries with Drizzle's TypeScript integration
- Implement proper migrations using Drizzle's migration tools
- Utilize Drizzle's query builder for complex queries
- Keep database schema in sync with your TypeScript types
- Leverage Drizzle's relation system for managing database relationships
- Use Drizzle's transaction API for atomic operations

Always create an new file every time you create a new schema for the database. this is very essientail for the readablity of the files.if a sechema need a relation don't froget to add it up. 
And lastly export the file in [index.ts](mdc:schema/index.ts)
