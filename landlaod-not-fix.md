Based on our implementation so far, we still need to:

1. Fix the type errors in the `landlord-setup-flow.tsx` file:
   - Replace the generic `any` types with specific types
   - Make the property/management types match the expected enum values

2. Address the linter errors in the `ListingConfirmation` component:
   - Fix the image accessibility issues in the photo preview section
   - Define proper types for the form data properties

3. Update the `PreferenceValue` type in the user context to support our complex form data structure, as the current type expects simpler key-value pairs.

4. Ensure the newly created components are properly integrated with the application's state management and routing.

5. Implement any backend API integrations for actually saving the property data to a database when the user publishes the listing (currently we only have client-side state).

The main structure and UI flow of the landlord property setup is in place, but these type and integration issues need to be resolved to make it fully functional.
